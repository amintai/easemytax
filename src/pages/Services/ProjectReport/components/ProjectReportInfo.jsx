            A Project Report is the formal documentation disclosing the details of a Prospective Project's detailed analytical aspects where technical, financial, and managerial data will be presented. The analysis of the future project's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats must be presented. Among these, the strengths and opportunities should be greater than the other two so that your project or business prospect remains feasible and profitable. So, a positive feasibility ratio must be presented to secure a loan from any investor or bank.
