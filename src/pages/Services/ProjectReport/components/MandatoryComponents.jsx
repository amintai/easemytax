            A project report includes the details of the project's goals, timeline, activities, resources to be used, the challenges faced, challenges coping up planning, results achieved, the way to pay EMI, and the justification of the entire planning. These are not the end of the list of facts that you have to submit. The Report serves as a formal record for the lifecycle of the project, where you have to submit the documents of the work done, the way to communicate the project status, and the possibility of sponsors, stakeholders, or any other interested parties. Project reports are used for various fields, but we produce them for new business or startups to secure a loan from investors/Banks.
